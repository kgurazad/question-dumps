The origin of one part of this action is found in the fourth section of the an-Nissa surah. This action is considered the "muftah al Jennah" and is performed after the rise from the sujood of the last rak'ah. In one sect, performing this action is preceded by stating  "At-Tahiyyatu lillahi," while acknowledging the "Wali" of Allah is essential to the Shi'a version. One must meet the seven conditions of earnestness before meaningfully doing this. All humans are born with fitra associated with this action, so conservatives call people who perform it for the first time in front of another Muslim reverts rather than converts. For 10 points, name this pillar of Islam which is the declaration that there is no god but Allah.
